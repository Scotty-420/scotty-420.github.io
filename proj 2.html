    <pre><div class="about">
  <p style="font-size:2vw;">My interest for IT has been around since i was around about 7,
      although not as a profession but merely as a hobby.
      Gaming was the inital interest <em>until</em> i started to wonder,
      what makes this machine tick?


      It was not until much later i found myself learning networking and IT essentials
      but i now find myself learning python and basic web development.
      I would like to specialize in python at first as it would be a good basis for
      someone such as myself who is new to the programming and designing scene
